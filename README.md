```
Give examples
```


### Installing

*A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running*

*Say what the step will be*

```
Give the example
```

*And repeat*

```
until finished
```

## License

*You don’t have to add a license to your Milestone 2 Project, but you can. It is a common part of a repo that specifies how the project can be used. Kinds of licenses allowing public use are very similar but have small differences that might matter for a specific project. The MIT or GNU general license are usually fine for a public repo.*

*This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details*


## Acknowledgments

 - *Citing someone else's code or resources used in the project*
 - *Inspiration*
 - *etc*


## Post-MVP Plans

- *Also called stretch goals*
- *One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.*
- *Another that will be a stretch.*
- *Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)*

*After you finish making/deploying your app, make sure to update and finalize the README.md file for the project, which should be in the top level of your files in the repo so that it's viewable right away when a user sees the "home page" of the repo. Of course, Github and your pinned projects are one of the most important ways for you to show potential employers your skill and professionalism. Make sure there are no glaring spelling errors (this is a great extension to spell check in VSCode: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker).*


*## WHEN YOU'RE READY TO SUBMIT THE PROJECT, MAKE SURE TO REMOVE ALL TEXT IN ITALICS ABOVE AND ALL TEXT BELOW THIS POINT. NOTE: THE README IS NOT JUST A PLACE TO TELL OTHERS ABOUT THE CODE IN YOUR APP, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE A PART OF THE WAY YOU PLAN AND KEEP TRACK OF YOUR PROGRESS BUILDING THE APP. ##*


## Project Planning

| Date | Goals |
| ---- | ----- |
| Sun. 5/19| Discuss project guidelines and resources; teams choose roles and team project specs; set up project repo; git team workflow demo and practice; team management app selection and feature brainstorm|
| Tues. 5/21| Meet in main room for a few minutes then hold brief standup meetings in breakout rooms before continuing to work on the project during class |    
| Thurs. 5/23 | Meet in main room to discuss deployment possibilities and begin preparation for deployment. Then teams hold brief standup meetings in breakout rooms, discuss possible deployment platform/s and choose it/them, then continue to work on the project in class. |
| Sun. 5/26 | Memorial Day Holiday; no class |
| Tues. 5/28 | Meet in the main room for a few minutes then hold final standup meetings before presentation day; your project should be deployed, and all features contained in the app should work to satisfy all project requirements as shown on Canvas, in the Grading Sheet Example on the widget, and your team's Project Plan doc |  
| Thurs. 5/30 | Meet in main room for a few minutes then meet in breakout rooms to fix up any loose ends toward deployment and make sure all assignment specs are met (except polishing up the README.md); do a final check and submit your completed project and project requirements checklist on your team's Project Plan Doc; in the last 1-1.5 hours of class, your team will present your project according to brief specs discussed on Canvas and in class |

## API Endpoints

It’s common for developers to show the various endpoints in their frontend and/or backend API/s as you would find in a third-party API provider. 

This resource shows examples of different ways you can show your endpoints: https://github.com/bufferapp/README/blob/master/billing/api-endpoints.md.


## ERD/Schema Diagram

*You should likely be using a tool (an app, pen and paper, etc.) to make an ERD (Entity Relational Diagram) and you may or may not put it in your README.*

*if you’re using a UI platform such as PgAdmin4 for a relational database, there's usually a built-in feature that makes an ERD diagrams from your tables for you automatically! PgAdmin4 has this feature.*

*However, this won't work if you're sketching out your tables from the beginning, which is a great way to organize them in your mind, especially with a table with many fields and/or associations.

*In that case, you should use an external tool such as Visual Paradigm: https://online.visual-paradigm.com/. This has proven to be the best for making ERD diagrams from scratch, IMHO, than the commonly used Draw.io. Visual Paradigm's free tier is forever and feature-rich.* 


*As for making a schema diagram for a document database (i.e., a NoSQL database such as MongoDb), you'll likely have to use an external tool for it. The easiest one for it I've seen is here: https://nosqldbm.ru/#/*
